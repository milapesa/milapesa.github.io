										<h2>About me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am Mila from Argentina and I'm a Gameplay Programmer. Recently i had the oportunity to work on an un announced extraction open world realtime multiplayer shooter game at Nimble Giant Entertainment. Currently I'm a student on ORT University in the System's Analyst Career, giving me knowlege from software development while working on the gaming industry. Before becoming a developer I was a QA Analyst Embedded at the same company in the Artificial Intelligence Team.</p>
									<p>Since I was a kid I loved to watch gameplays for hours before i got the chance to play them on a good computer. My favourite genre is Horror, Adventure and Decision Making games. I hope I'll continue on this path and motivate other people to join this great world of video games.</p>

									<p><b>The following projects were all developed in Unreal Engine 4 & 5 using C++</b></p>

												<p>This game was made in the last Ludum Dare Jam 51 where I got the chance to work with my friends for 48 hours to make a fun game. The Sinopsis is: Is it a dream? Is it another planet? Is it a looped nightmare as a result of a bad trip? We’ll never know, what we do know is that you have to survive the terrible nights and enjoy the quiet days while you can</p>
												<p>Implemented some abilities of the main character in single-player games using GAS. Implementation of different UI interfaces using the Unreal Engine widget system & development of the behaviour of the AIs. Apart from unreal engine 5, we used mural, jira and perforce to manage our workspace.</p>

											<h3>Nimble Technical Test </h3>
											<a href="#" class="image"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYIcjOwMbQU" alt="" allow="fullscreen;" style="height: 400px; width:700px;"></iframe></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<p>In this project the players have to escape a broken spaceship that landed on an stranded frozen planet by shooting the walls that are blocking the exit. They'll have to be a team to make it out. 
												</p>
												<p>It's a multiplayer shooter game with a pyramid of random cubes that can be destroyed if hit. Similar to tetris where the player needs to hit the same rows of colors. </p>
												<p>While making this project I learned how to use implement GAS to add abilities to the player for example the Leaning Ability and modify the networking of such using replicated flags in the character movement component. The characters can take damage using niagara particles for blood and ragdoll.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbktyXqkxUw" alt="" allow="fullscreen;" style="height: 400px; width:700px;"></iframe></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<p>This was a project I made through a course to learn the basics of unreal engine. In this first approach I learned how collisions work, widgets, animation state machines, sound events and even behavior trees, different senses for the AI.</p>
												<p>It's a first person game for PC, I made level design and basic mechanics of a First Person Shooter (character movement), UI, defeat and victory condition. I programmed and configured an AI for the game. Finally I also provided feedback to the player through sounds and UI effects</p>

										<p class= "col-6 col-12-medium">
										I attended the Nasa SpaceApps Hackathon from Buenos Aires and it was amazing, we were a team of 8 people and we had tons of fun. We have chosen the Ocean Clean Up challenge and presented our project called "Action Point" in which you can visualize in the app/ platform where are the contaminated areas and report one if you encounter it, its all thanks to the data from Nasa's satellites and Argentine Satellites. In the end we won the category "Intergalactic Impact" and went home with gigantic smile.</p>
